In this assignment I created an arraylist and linkedlist and added 100,000 random integers into each list.  Then we use the .get() method to retrieve 
100,000 integers from both lists. And finally we insert 100,000 more integers into each list again. By using the .nanoTime() method we can calculate run times of 
these various operations.
